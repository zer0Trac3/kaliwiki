NAME
       packetforge-ng - forge packets: ARP, UDP, ICMP or custom packets.

SYNOPSIS
       packetforge-ng <mode> <options>

DESCRIPTION
       packetforge-ng  is  a  tool to create encrypted packets that can subse
       quently be used for injection. You may create various types of  packets
       such as arp requests, UDP, ICMP and custom packets. The most common use
       is to create ARP requests for subsequent injection.
       To create an encrypted packet, you must have a PRGA (pseudo random gen
       ration  algorithm) file. This is used to encrypt the packet you create.
       This is typically obtained from aireplay-ng chopchop  or  fragmentation
       attacks.
