NAME
       airolib-ng - manage and create a WPA/WPA2 pre-computed hashes tables

SYNOPSIS
       airolib-ng <database> <operation> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       airolib-ng  is  a  tool  for  the aircrack-ng suite to store and manage
       essid and password lists, compute their Pairwise Master Keys (PMKs) and
       use them in WPA/WPA2 cracking. The program uses the lightweight SQLite3
       database as the storage mechanism which is available on most platforms.
       The  SQLite3  database  was  selected  taking in consideration platform
       availability plus management, memory and disk overhead.

              invalid PMK in the database will be deleted.

              Import a flat file as a list of ESSIDs or passwords.
