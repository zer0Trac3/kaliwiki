NAME
       airuncloak-ng - Removes wep cloaked framed from a pcap file.

SYNOPSIS
       airuncloak-ng <options>

DESCRIPTION
       airuncloak-ng  is  a  tool  that removes wep cloaking from a pcap file.
       Some WIPS (actually one) can actively "prevent" cracking a WEP  key  by
       inserting  chaff  (fake  wep frames) in the air to fool aircrack-ng. In
       some rare cases, cloaking fails and the key can  be  recovered  without
       removing  this  chaff.  In the cases where the key cannot be recovered,
       use this tool to filter out chaff.

       The program works by reading the input file and selecting packets  from
       a  specific network.  Each selected packet is put into a list and clas
       sified (default status is "unknown"). Filters are then applied (in  the
       order  specified by the user) on this list. They will change the status
       of the packets (unknown, uncloaked, potentially  cloaked  or  cloaked).
       The  order  of  the  filters is really important since each filter will
       base its analysis amongst other things on the status of the packets and
       different orders will give different results.

       Important requirement: The pcap file needs to have all packets (includ¬ê
       ing beacons and all other "useless" packets) for the analysis  (and  if
       possible, prism/radiotap headers).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Shows the help screen.

       -i <file>
              Path to the capture file.

       --ssid <ESSID>
              Essid of the network (not yet implemented) to filter.

       --bssid <BSSID>
              BSSID of the network to filter.

       --null-packets
              Assume that null packets can be cloaked.

       --disable-base-filter
              Do not apply base filter.

       --drop-frag
              Drop fragmented packets.

       --filters <filters>
              Apply different filters (separated by a comma). See below.

FILTERS
       signal Try  to filter based on signal (prism or radiotap headers in the
              pcap file).

       duplicate_sn
              Remove all duplicate sequence numbers for both the  AP  and  the
              client (that are close to each other).

       duplicate_sn_ap
              Remove duplicate sequence number for the AP only (that are close
              to each other).

       duplicate_sn_client
              Remove duplicate sequence number for the client only  (that  are
              close to each other).

       consecutive_sn
              Filter based on the fact that IV should be consecutive (only for
              AP).

       duplicate_iv
              Filter out all duplicate IV.

       signal_dup_consec_sn
              Use signal (if available), duplicate  and  consecutive  sequence
              number (filtering is much more precise than using all these fil
              ters one by one).
