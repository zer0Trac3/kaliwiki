NAME
       airtun-ng - a virtual tunnel interface creator for aircrack-ng

SYNOPSIS
       airtun-ng [options] <interface name>

DESCRIPTION
       airtun-ng  creates  a  virtual tunnel interface (atX) for sending arbi
       trary IP packets by using raw ieee802.11 packet injection.

OPTIONS
       -H, --help
              Shows the help screen.

       -x <pps>
              Sets maximum number of packets per second.

       -a <BSSID>
              Specifies the BSSID for the iee802.11 header. In WDS  Mode  this
              sets the Receiver.

       -h <SMAC>
              Specifies the source MAC for the iee802.11 header.

       -i <iface>
              Sets the capture interface.

       -r <file>
              Specifies a file to read 802.11 frames.

       -y <PRGA-file>
              Is  the  name  of the file, which provides the keystream for WEP
              encoding. (No receiving, just transmitting of IP packets.)

       -w <WEP-key>
              This is the WEP key to en-/decrypt all traffic going through the
              tunnel.

       -t <tods>
              Defines  the  ToDS  and FromDS bit in the ieee802.11 header. For
              tods=1, the ToDS bit is set to 1 and FromDS to 0,  while  tods=0
              sets them the other way around. If set to 2, it will be tunneled
              in a WDS/bridge.

       -m <netmask>, --netmask <netmask>
              Filters networks based on bssid ^ netmask combination. Needs -d,
              used in replay mode.

       -d <BSSID>, --bssid <BSSID>
              Filters networks based on the <BSSID>. Used in replay mode.

       -f, --repeat
              Enables replay mode. All read frames, filtered by bssid and net‐
              mask (if specified), will be replayed.

       -s <transmitter>
              Set Transmitter MAC address for WDS Mode.

       -b     Bidirectional mode. This enables communication in  Transmitter's
              AND  Receiver's  networks.  Works  only if you can see both sta‐
              tions.

EXAMPLES
       airtun-ng -a 00:14:22:56:F3:4E -t 0 -y keystream.xor wlan0
