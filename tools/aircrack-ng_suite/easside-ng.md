NAME
       easside-ng  - an auto-magic tool which allows you to communicate via an
       WEP-encrypted AP without knowing the key

SYNOPSIS
       easside-ng <options>

DESCRIPTION
       easside-ng is an auto-magic tool which allows you to communicate via an
       WEP-encrypted  access  point (AP) without knowing the WEP key. It first
       identifies a network, then proceeds to associate with it,  obtain  PRGA
       (pseudo random generation algorithm) xor data, determine the network IP
       scheme and then setup a TAP interface so that you can communicate  with
       the  AP  without  requiring  the WEP key. All this is done without your
       intervention.
