NAME
       tkiptun-ng - inject a few frames into a WPA TKIP network with QoS

SYNOPSIS
       tkiptun-ng [options] <replay interface>

DESCRIPTION
       tkiptun-ng is a tool created by Martin Beck aka hirte, a member of air
       crack-ng team. This tool is able to inject a few frames into a WPA TKIP
       network with QoS. He worked with Erik Tews (who created PTW attack) for
       a conference in PacSec 2008: "Gone in 900 Seconds, Some  Crypto  Issues
       with WPA".
